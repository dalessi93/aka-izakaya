## Design Brief

Japanese Resturant that has the ability to show customers the food and drinks menu. This website also has a Admin portal that gives the client the ability to "CRUD" the menu items.

### Challenges
Even though Bootstrap is a feature rich CSS framework, the team found it difficult to easily insert in to the site code in some scenarios. The general concensious was that it was "Bootstraps way or the highway". 

There were some instances of Merge conflicts, however this project gave the team to time to practice resolving these issues as a group. 

Over the development of the website there were instances of silly mistakes / codes not complete that left the team mind boggled until someone had a lightbulb moment.
